// Variables
// let, const, var
// let and var are interchangable while const is a constant that cannot be changed

//Example
// let a = 10
// console.log(`The initial value of a is: ${a}`)
// a = 15
// ^ we declared a variable named a which was originally assigned as 10
// console.log(`Now the value of a is: ${a}`)

//Functions
// A function is a reusable block of a code
function firstName(/*parameters are inserted here*/name){
    return `My name is ${name}`
}
console.log(firstName('Andy'))
console.log(firstName('Vireak'))
